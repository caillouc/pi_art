# Pi art 

This project is largely inspired by [Martin Krzywinski](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/)

The python file `pi_art.py` will generate a high quality `jpeg` image and a
`svg` file representing the 314159 first digits of pi in a nice looking way. An
example is shown below. 

To change the color of the graph simply edit the line  `c = "RdBu"` in the
python code. `c` is simply the name of a [matplotlib
colormap](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html)
